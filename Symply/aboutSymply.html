        <h1>Why Symply?</h1>
        <p>
            Many people who suffer from chronic illnesses often go undiagnosed or untreated. It can be difficult to quantify the
            severity of symptoms or the effectiveness of new treatments, such as medication. This can create a communication gap
            between the patient and their healthcare provider that can result in inadequate care.
            <br>
            Bridging this communication gap is vital to ensuring patients get the treatment that they actually need. To do this, we
            will try to achieve goal 3 of the 2016 Sustainable Development Goals and provide a service that facilitates the tracking of symptoms and monitoring of health indicators such as mood,
            sleep, appetite, activity, and pain.
        </p>
        <h1>Why is this important?</h1>
        <p>
            This is an important problem because chronic illnesses are a global phenomenon. In addition to experiencing difficulties
            communicating their symptoms and the effectiveness of treatment, sufferers may also have trouble understanding their
            illness and how it affects their life, and may be less apt to seek treatment in the first place.
        <br>
            Our target users are sufferers of chronic illnesses and their healthcare providers. It is important to design the system
            for both patients and their doctors to ensure that the data being tracked is useful and indicative of actual health
            factors. They should care because this will increase the effectiveness of communication and allow patients to quantify
            the effects of treatment on their illness.
        </p>
        <h1>How Many People Benefit?</h1>
        <p>
            According to the CDC, 6 in 10 adults in the US have a chronic disease, while 4 in 10 adults have two or more.
            Additionally, data from the 2015-16 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicates that 45.8% of the US
            population had used prescription drugs in the past 30 days. Due to the differences in diagnosis of various chronic
            illnesses, exact numbers vary. However, it is clear that the majority of people have or will experience a chronic
            illness in their lifetime.
        </p>
        <h1>What is Symply?</h1>
        <p>
            Our proposed solution is a mobile app that provides a suite of features to help quantify how an illness affects a userâ€™s
            life, and how their symptoms are affected by particular treatments. We will design our solution around feedback from
            both patients and doctors to target data inputs that are meaningful to health and wellbeing.
            Beyond simply tracking symptoms, our solution will help users in their daily lives by providing specific, customizable
            reminders for things like medication, self-care, and appointments.
            
            Our solution will use a mobile app system. We want to ensure that our system will be accessible to the majority of our
            potential users. According to the Pew Research Center, over 80% of US adults owned a smartphone in 2018, and that number
            is projected to have risen in the following years. Using a mobile app will also simplify the process of sharing
            collected data with healthcare providers.
